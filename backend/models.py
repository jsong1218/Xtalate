"""Wire models the *service* owns — not the library's report models.

The library's report models (``DiscoveryReport``, ``ConversionReport``, ``ValidationReport``)
cross the wire **verbatim** — no DTOs, no renames (Part 6 preamble; v0.5 standing rule 2). The
models here are the ones the transport itself introduces and the library has no opinion about:
the error envelope, the limits view, and the health/readiness response. They live in ``backend``
precisely because they are API concerns, not canonical-model concerns.
